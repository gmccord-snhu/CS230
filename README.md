CS-230 Final Project SNHU

## Client and Software Requirements

The client, *The Gaming Room*, is a game development company looking to expand their popular Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a web-based application that supports multiple platforms. They required a software solution that would maintain the original gameplay, user interface, and game rules, while also offering a seamless cross-platform experience. The goal was to design a scalable, user-friendly system with the ability to host multiple teams and players, validate game and team names, and ensure only one instance of the game runs at any given time.

## What Went Well in Developing This Documentation

The requirements were clearly defined, offering a comprehensive roadmap for the development process. By including business and technical requirements, design constraints, and system architecture, the document ensured that all aspects of the project were thoroughly considered before development began. This section involved significant thought, research, and attention to detail, which ultimately strengthened the overall document.

## What Was Helpful About Working Through the Design Document

Working through the design document was incredibly helpful in creating a clear vision for how the software should function. By outlining the system architecture, data flow, and user requirements, it made the coding process more efficient and focused. It provided a solid understanding of the bigger picture, helping me see exactly what needed to be built and offering a roadmap for implementing the necessary features while ensuring scalability. Additionally, the document helped answer many of my questions, providing insights into what the client truly needed and allowing me to tailor the design to meet their expectations.

## What Would I Revise?

If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on the "Recommendations" section. While it provides a solid direction, I think it could benefit from more specific technical details about the chosen technologies. For instance, providing more information about the exact frameworks, libraries, and server configurations would make it clearer how the recommendations align with the project’s requirements. This section was challenging to refine, especially since we lacked information about the client’s budget, their team's readiness, or their willingness to train employees on new operating systems.

## How Did I Interpret the User's Needs?

Interpreting the user’s needs involved carefully analyzing the business requirements while keeping in mind the player experience and the client’s goals. I focused on features that would enhance gameplay, such as supporting multiple platforms, improving team management, and ensuring a seamless user interface. Considering the user’s needs is critical when designing because a game’s success depends on meeting players' expectations, keeping them engaged, and offering an intuitive experience. At this stage, the requirements should still remain high-level, but they should be detailed enough to move forward into a more refined definition, like an SRS or more detailed follow-up design documents.

## Approach to Software Design

My approach to software design involved using a modular and scalable structure. I started by identifying key components of the game (like player management and game state handling) and designing the architecture to be flexible for future updates. In the future, I would use similar techniques like object-oriented design, incorporating design patterns where necessary, and continuously iterating on feedback from both users and stakeholders. A solid design document provides a foundation for these techniques, ensuring a smooth transition from planning to coding.

In the future, I would continue using these techniques, such as object-oriented design and incorporating design patterns where appropriate. Continuously iterating on feedback from users and stakeholders would also be a key part of the process. A solid design document is crucial as it provides the foundation for these techniques, ensuring a smooth transition from planning to coding and helping to keep the system aligned with the long-term vision.

## Conclusion

A well-crafted requirements document upfront doesn't need to account for every detail, but it provides a solid foundation to build upon for future updates to the system. Changes are inevitable once the project gets underway, and having this initial document allows those changes to be assessed against the original requirements. As the project evolves, the document can be amended and refined, ensuring that the development stays aligned with the core objectives while allowing room for flexibility and adjustments as needed. This approach ensures that the project remains on track and that modifications are well-structured and purposeful.
